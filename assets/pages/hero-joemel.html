                <strong>Joemel - The Eternal Hashira</strong>

                <br />
                <br />

                Once one of the deadliest Hashira, Joemel lived over five
                thousand years ago. He was a master of Stone Hardening and Foil
                Breathing techniques, wielding them with unmatched skill. Above
                all, Joemel possessed an extraordinary ability to adapt to any
                battle, making him an unstoppable force in the fight against
                darkness. His legendary prowess and adaptability have made him a
                figure of myth and inspiration for generations of warriors.

                <br />
                <br />

                Joemel was also an Imaginary Trapper, a skill he acquired from
                his friend, Sivergel, who taught him this unique ability. This
                rare technique allowed him to manipulate and trap his enemies in
                powerful illusions, further solidifying his reputation as an
                invincible warrior.

                <br />
                <br />

                One of Joemel's most fearsome abilities was Battle Adaptation:
                his capacity to learn and counter any opponent's fighting style,
                turning their strengths against them. However, due to his lack
                of full nen charge, Joemel was unable to fully utilize this
                skill, making it a dormant potential within him. Despite this
                limitation, his other abilities made him a formidable adversary.
                In his earlier days, Joemel was part of a legendary group called
                The Four, consisting of himself, Ryan, Vergel, and Angelo. They
                were inseparable friends and formidable warriors. However, a
                great misunderstanding and a deep-seated disagreement caused a
                rift among them. The once unbreakable bond shattered, splitting
                them into two factions: Joemel and Ryan on one side, Vergel and
                Angelo on the other. This division led to an epic conflict known
                as the 4th Impact.

                <br />
                <br />

                Angelo, once a dear friend, became Joemel's main adversary.
                Angelo established a vast empire known as the
                <strong>Ays Empire</strong>, where he ruled with an iron fist.
                The battles between Joemel's and Angelo's factions were
                legendary, echoing through history as monumental clashes of
                power and skill.
